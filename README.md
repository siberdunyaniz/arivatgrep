## 🔎 **Pro Tips**  

- **Proxy Management**: The tool uses a predefined proxy list. Update it in `arivatgrep.py` if proxies become unreliable.  
- **Rate Limits**: Telegram may throttle excessive requests. Use moderate complaint counts to stay under the radar.  
- **Option 5 Nuance**: Requires a valid phone number for stolen account complaints, unlike others that auto-generate data.  
- **Customization**: Tweak complaint messages or proxy lists in the script for personalized functionality.
